We divided our roles to work on MP7 assignment.

Gajan mainly worked on graphic interface, while Riku worked on basic algorithms of TicTacToe.

To avoid merge conflict, instead of completing the program in one class, we separated it by two files.

Our tic-tac-toe project referenced MP5, ConnectN to understand the logic of 2d-array game.

WE:

Did something original! We googled and stack-overflowed enough to create this masterpiecel. We used graphic interface instead of text-based - that is something new from what we learned in CS125 MPs.

Ensured that both partners have roles in the project! - check the above sentences of this document.

Presented your work during your final lab section! - Please check with our Lab TA.

Properly published our work on GitHub - I hope you are reading this on github website... :-)
